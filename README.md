## Simulate Planet Physics


This project aims to simulate the movement of planets, astroids and other bodies in space that are governed by the laws of astrophysics and imitates gravitational forces of the universe!

Of course there's been some "small" assumptions and approximations made about the complexity of the interactions and the size of the universe. But overall, based on the mass, radius and the distances from other bodies, the simulates the movements of asteroids, axis of rotation and orbits of planets.
